# Understanding Numeric Data Types in Databases

## Introduction
- In this tutorial, we'll explore numeric data types in databases, their purpose, and how they help maintain data accuracy and integrity.

## Data Types in Databases
- When designing a database, it's crucial to specify the data types for each column.
- Data types define the kind of data that can be stored in a column and help prevent data entry errors.

## Numeric Data Types
- Numeric data types are a category of data types used to store numbers.
- They are essential for managing numerical data in databases.
- The two primary numeric data types are:
  1. **Integer**: Used for whole numbers.
  2. **Decimal**: Used for numbers with fractions.

## Integer Data Type
- The integer data type stores whole numbers without fractions.
- It is ideal for columns where fractional values are not required.
- Example: Storing quantities of products as whole numbers.

## Decimal Data Type
- The decimal data type is used for numbers that may have fractions or decimal points.
- It is suitable for columns that require precise decimal values.
- Example: Storing prices or measurements with decimal values.

## Use Case Example
- Consider an online store database with a "Products" table.
- The "Quantity" column could be defined as an integer data type because it deals with whole product quantities.
- The "Price" column, which requires decimal values to represent accurate prices, could be defined as a decimal data type.

## Specific Numeric Data Types
- Database management systems often provide various specific numeric data types.
- These types have predefined ranges for minimum and maximum values.
- For example, MySQL offers TINYINT for very small integers and INT for larger integers.
- Numeric data types can also handle both negative and positive values.

## Importance of Data Types
- Data types ensure data consistency and accuracy in a database.
- They help prevent incorrect data entry by specifying the expected format for each column.
- Using appropriate numeric data types is vital for effective database design.

## Conclusion
- Numeric data types are crucial for managing numerical data in databases.
- Understanding the difference between integer and decimal data types is essential for choosing the right data type for each column.
- Proper data type selection ensures data integrity and accuracy in the database.
