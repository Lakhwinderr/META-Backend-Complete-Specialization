# Common SQL Commands

In this lesson, we'll explore the main SQL commands used for interacting with relational databases. SQL (Structured Query Language) is a powerful language for retrieving, managing, and manipulating data in databases. These commands are categorized into DDL, DML, DCL, and TCL, based on their functionality and the types of operations they perform.

## Data Definition Language (DDL)

DDL commands are used to define, delete, and modify database structures, such as tables.

### CREATE Command

- Purpose: Create a new database or tables within a database.
- Syntax: `CREATE TABLE table_name (column_name1 datatype(size), column_name2 datatype(size), column_name3 datatype(size));`

### DROP Command

- Purpose: Delete a database or a table inside the database.
- Syntax: `DROP TABLE table_name;`

### ALTER Command

- Purpose: Modify table structures (e.g., change table name, add a primary key, add or delete columns).
- Syntax to add a column: `ALTER TABLE table_name ADD (column_name datatype(size));`
- Syntax to add a primary key: `ALTER TABLE table_name ADD primary key (column_name);`

### TRUNCATE Command

- Purpose: Remove all records from a table, emptying the table without deleting it.
- Syntax: `TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;`

### COMMENT Command

- Purpose: Add comments to SQL statements for documentation (not part of database construction).
- Syntax: `-- Comment here`

## Data Manipulation Language (DML)

DML commands are used to query, insert, update, and delete data in the database.

### SELECT Command

- Purpose: Retrieve data from tables in the database.
- Syntax: `SELECT * FROM table_name;`

### INSERT Command

- Purpose: Add records of data into an existing table.
- Syntax: `INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3) VALUES (value1, value2, value3);`

### UPDATE Command

- Purpose: Modify or update data within a table.
- Syntax: `UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2 WHERE condition;`

### DELETE Command

- Purpose: Delete data from a table.
- Syntax: `DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;`

## Data Control Language (DCL)

DCL commands deal with user rights and permissions within the database.

### GRANT Command

- Purpose: Provide users with privileges to access and manipulate the database.

### REVOKE Command

- Purpose: Remove permissions from users.

## Transaction Control Language (TCL)

TCL commands manage transactions in the database.

### COMMIT Command

- Purpose: Save all changes made in the database.

### ROLLBACK Command

- Purpose: Restore the database to the last committed state.

These SQL commands are essential for performing various operations in a relational database, and you will explore them in more detail as you continue your SQL learning journey.
