# Interacting with Databases Using SQL

In this section of the course, we'll explore how to interact with databases, a crucial skill for a data engineer. To accomplish this, we'll use Structured Query Language, commonly known as SQL (pronounced as sequel). Let's delve into what SQL is and its role in working with databases.

## Understanding SQL

- **SQL Definition**: SQL is the standard language for interacting with databases, making it a vital tool for data engineers.
- **SQL Universality**: SQL is versatile and compatible with all types of databases, but it shines when dealing with relational databases that rely on structured data.
- **Examples**: SQL can be used with various relational databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server.

## Database Interactions

Data engineers perform various operations, often referred to as CRUD operations, which stand for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. These operations allow for data manipulation within databases. While we will explore these operations in detail later in the course, it's essential to understand their significance.

## Role of DBMS

To interpret and execute SQL instructions, databases rely on a Database Management System (DBMS). When working as a data engineer or web developer, you'll use a DBMS to interact with the database. The DBMS takes SQL instructions and converts them into a format that the underlying database can understand.

This brief introduction provides an overview of SQL and its role in interacting with databases. In the following videos, we will delve deeper into SQL, gaining a more comprehensive understanding of this powerful language.
