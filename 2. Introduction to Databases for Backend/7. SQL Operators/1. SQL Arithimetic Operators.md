# Notes on SQL Arithmetic Operators

## Introduction to SQL Arithmetic Operators

- SQL allows you to calculate important aspects like salary increases and allowances efficiently using arithmetic operators.
- This video aims to explain SQL arithmetic operators, their usage, and their significance in performing database operations.

## Understanding Operators in SQL

- **Operators** in SQL are specific words or characters used to perform various activities in a database.
- They function like conjunctions in sentences or operation keys on a calculator.
- Operators are crucial for querying and manipulating data within a database.

## Importance of Operators

- Operators are essential when working with data in a database.
- They enable you to perform diverse activities, such as calculating leave days or assessing employee performance.
- SQL offers various types of operators, each with distinct functions.

## Exploring Arithmetic Operators

- **Arithmetic operators** are widely used in computer languages for calculations and returning results.
- They resemble common arithmetic operators in mathematics.
- In SQL, the main arithmetic operators and their symbols are:
  - `+` for addition
  - `-` for subtraction
  - `*` for multiplication
  - `/` for division
  - `%` for modulus (provides the remainder of a division)

## How Arithmetic Operations Work

- An operator in SQL takes two operands and produces a result.
- For instance, an addition operator takes 5 and 5 as operands and yields 10 as the result.
- SQL applies this concept using the `SELECT` command.

## Using Arithmetic Operators in SQL

- SQL allows you to perform basic mathematical operations using arithmetic operators.
- **Addition Example:** To add two numbers (e.g., 10 + 15):
  - Use `SELECT` followed by the operands separated by a plus operator (`+`), and end with a semicolon (`;`).
  - The query retrieves the sum of 10 + 15 and displays it as 25.

```sql
-- SQL Code for Addition
SELECT 10 + 15;
```

## More Arithmetic Operations

- SQL supports other arithmetic operations similarly:
  - Subtraction: Use the minus sign (`-`) between operands.
  - Multiplication: Employ the asterisk (`*`) symbol.
  - Division: Utilize the forward slash (`/`) operator.
  - Modulus: Represented by the percentage sign (`%`).

```sql
-- SQL Code for Subtraction
SELECT 20 - 8;

-- SQL Code for Multiplication
SELECT 5 * 4;

-- SQL Code for Division
SELECT 25 / 5;
```

## Modulus Example

- **Modulus Example:** To find the remainder when dividing 100 by 10:
```sql
 SELECT 100 % 10;
```

  - The query calculates the result (remainder) as 0, indicating that 100 divided by 10 equals 10 with no remainder.

## Practical Application

- Understanding these arithmetic operators allows you to apply them practically in SQL for various tasks.
- You can perform more complex calculations and data manipulations using these operators effectively.
