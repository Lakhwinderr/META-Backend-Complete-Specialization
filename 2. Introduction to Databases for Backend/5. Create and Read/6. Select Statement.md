# SQL SELECT Statement

In SQL, you often need to query data from tables in your database. The primary tool for this task is the `SELECT` statement. In this guide, we'll explore the syntax of the `SELECT` statement and various ways to use it.

## Basic `SELECT` Statement

A basic `SELECT` statement follows this structure:
```sql
SELECT column_name
FROM table_name;
```

- `SELECT`: Keyword to retrieve data.
- `column_name`: Name of the column containing the data you want to query.
- `FROM`: Keyword that identifies the source table.
- `table_name`: Name of the table you want to query.

Optional: A semicolon `;` is often used to mark the end of a SQL statement.

### Example

Let's consider a soccer club database with a `players` table containing player details (ID, name, age, skill level). To retrieve all player names from this table:

```sql
SELECT name
FROM players;
```

This query returns a table with player names, each name on its own row.

## Retrieving Data from Multiple Columns

If you need to retrieve data from multiple columns, list them with commas:

```sql
SELECT name, level
FROM players;
```

This query retrieves both the player's name and skill level from the `players` table.

## Retrieving Data from All Columns

You can retrieve data from all columns in a table using two methods:

### Method 1: List All Column Names

Specify all column names in your `SELECT` statement:

```sql
SELECT ID, name, age, level
FROM players;
```

This query fetches data from all columns in the `players` table.

### Method 2: Use Asterisk (*)

An asterisk (*) acts as shorthand to select all columns:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM players;
```

This query returns all available data from all columns in the `players` table.

With these methods, you can effectively use the `SELECT` statement in SQL to query and retrieve data from your database tables. The choice between these methods depends on your specific data retrieval needs.
