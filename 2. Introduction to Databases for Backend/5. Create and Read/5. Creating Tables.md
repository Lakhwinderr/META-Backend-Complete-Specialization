## Creating Tables

This section covers the process of creating a table in a database. You've learned about creating and dropping a database using SQL commands such as `CREATE DATABASE` and `DROP DATABASE`. Additionally, you've been introduced to the SQL syntax for creating a table in the database using `CREATE TABLE` and modifying the structure of an existing table using `ALTER TABLE`.

The primary objective of this reading is to help you develop a practical understanding of how the `CREATE TABLE` statement works. You will also learn how to use its syntax correctly. Furthermore, this reading highlights some important points to consider when creating a database table.

## Important Points on Creating a Table

In SQL, the `CREATE TABLE` syntax is part of the Data Definition Language (DDL) subset, which is used to create a new database table. Here are some important points to remember when using the `CREATE TABLE` syntax, which are also useful for creating tables in general:

1. **Meaningful Names:** Always give meaningful names to your tables and their columns or fields.

2. **Data Types:** The data types of columns or fields may vary from one database system to another. For instance, `NUMBER` is supported in Oracle database for integer values, whereas `INT` is supported in MySQL. Refer to the list of data types supported by the specific database system you are using, such as MySQL, SQL Server, or Oracle.

3. **Specify Length:** Remember to specify the appropriate length for data types where applicable. For example, use `VARCHAR` for storing text-based data because it saves space. `VARCHAR` takes up 1 byte per character, plus another 2 bytes to hold the length. So, if you set a `VARCHAR(100)` data type for a first name column and store a value like "Jen" in it, it would take up 3 bytes (for J, E, and N) plus another 2 bytes, totaling 5 bytes to store that value.

## Using the CREATE TABLE Statement

Let's take a closer look at the `CREATE TABLE` syntax with an example. In this case, we will examine the syntax to create a table named `customers` in the sample database. This table includes the following columns/fields:

- CustomerId
- FirstName
- LastName
- Company
- Address
- City
- State
- Country
- PostalCode
- Phone
- Fax
- Email
- SupportRapid

The table is created using the following syntax:

```sql
CREATE TABLE customers
    (CustomerId INT, 
    FirstName VARCHAR(40), 
    LastName VARCHAR(20), 
    Company VARCHAR(80), 
    Address VARCHAR(70), 
    City VARCHAR(40),
    State VARCHAR(40), 
    Country VARCHAR(40), 
    PostalCode VARCHAR(10), 
    Phone VARCHAR(24), 
    Fax VARCHAR(24), 
    Email VARCHAR(60), 
    SupportRapid INT );   
```
# CREATE TABLE Syntax

In SQL, the primary syntax for creating a table is the `CREATE TABLE` statement. Here's a breakdown of the key elements involved:

1. **Table Name:** Begin by specifying the name of the table you want to create. In the example provided, the table name is `customers`.

2. **Parentheses:** After the table name, include a pair of parentheses `()`.

3. **Column Definitions:** Within the parentheses, you define the columns or fields of the table. For each column, specify the following information:
   - **Column Name:** Provide a name for the column. For instance, `CustomerId` and `SupportRapid` are examples of column names.
   - **Data Type:** Specify the data type of the column. In this case, `INT` is used for numeric values, while the rest of the fields have a data type of `VARCHAR`.
   - **Size or Length:** If applicable, indicate the size or length of data that can be stored in the column. The length is determined by the number of characters that need to be stored in each field.

4. **Semicolon:** Conclude the `CREATE TABLE` statement with a semicolon `;`.

In summary, the `CREATE TABLE` statement allows you to define the structure of your database table, including the column names, data types, and lengths where necessary. This statement is fundamental for creating tables in SQL databases.
