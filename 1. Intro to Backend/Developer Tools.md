# Understanding Web Browser Developer Tools

If a car breaks down, you can open the hood to examine the engine and find out what's gone wrong. Similarly, as a developer, if your front end isn't working as expected, you can also open the hood to check what's going wrong. In fact, it's not just your own code that you can investigate; you can also view other people's code.

## Accessing Web Browser Developer Tools

Most web browsers come equipped with a set of developer tools that allow developers to inspect their HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. These tools also enable you to trace HTTP requests to the web server, investigate performance issues, and review web page security.

To open the developer tools in Google Chrome:
- Press the F12 key on your keyboard for PC.
- Use the keyboard shortcut Command Option J on Mac.
- Right-click on the web page and select "Inspect."

## Overview of Developer Tools Tabs

There are various tabs on the top row of developer tools that provide different functionality:

1. **Console Tab:** This tab outputs JavaScript logs and errors from your web application.

2. **Sources Tab:** It shows all content resolved for the current page, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and videos.

3. **Network Tab:** You can inspect the timeline and details of HTTP requests and responses for the web page.

4. **Performance Tab:** This tab shows what the web browser is doing over time, helping you pinpoint functions that might be slowing down your web application.

5. **Memory Tab:** It displays the parts of your code that are consuming the most resources.

6. **Elements Tab:** The most commonly used tab. You can use it to inspect the document's HTML elements and their properties. You can also edit the HTML in the web browser for testing purposes.

## Editing HTML in the Web Browser

A handy trick is that you can double-click on HTML elements in the Elements tab to edit them in the web browser. This doesn't change the content on the web server; it only updates it for you while the web page is open. If you reopen the web page, it will reset.

## Conclusion

Web browser developer tools are a valuable part of your development toolkit, helping you investigate and diagnose problems in your web applications. You now know how to access and make use of them effectively.
