# Learning SQL: Basics and Subsets

In this lesson, we'll explore the fundamentals of SQL (Structured Query Language) and its subsets, including Data Definition Language (DDL), Data Manipulation Language (DML), and Data Query Language (DQL).

## SQL Overview

- SQL is a language for interacting with databases.
- It consists of subsets that allow us to create, modify, query, and manage databases.

## Creating a Database

- Use the Data Definition Language (DDL) to create a new database.
- Syntax: `CREATE DATABASE database_name;`
- Example: `CREATE DATABASE college;`

## Creating Tables

- Use DDL to create tables within a database.
- Syntax: `CREATE TABLE table_name;`
- Example: `CREATE TABLE student;`

## Inserting Data

- Utilize Data Manipulation Language (DML) to add data to tables.
- Syntax: `INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...) VALUES (value1, value2, ...);`
- Example: `INSERT INTO student (ID, first_name, last_name, date_of_birth) VALUES (1, 'John', 'Murphy', '1995-03-15');`

## Updating Data

- Modify existing data using DML.
- Syntax: `UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2 WHERE condition;`
- Example: `UPDATE student SET date_of_birth = '1993-06-22' WHERE ID = 2;`

## Deleting Data

- Delete data from tables using DML.
- Syntax: `DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;`
- Example: `DELETE FROM student WHERE ID = 3;`

## Querying Data

- Retrieve data from tables using Data Query Language (DQL).
- Syntax: `SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;`
- Example: `SELECT first_name FROM student WHERE ID = 1;`

## Conclusion

- SQL is a powerful language for managing databases.
- DDL, DML, and DQL subsets allow us to create, modify, query, and manage data effectively.

Remember, this is just an introduction to SQL. You will explore each subset in more detail as you progress in your SQL learning journey.
