# Understanding Database Tables

In this lesson, you'll gain a comprehensive understanding of database tables, their structure, and key concepts associated with them.

## What Is a Database Table?

- **Database Table**: A fundamental component of a database system used to store and organize data.
- **Structure**: Comprised of rows (records) and columns (fields) that hold data.
- **Relations**: Multiple tables in a database relate to one another, forming the relational model.

## Conceptual Terms

- **Entities**: In an Object-Oriented Database (OODB), tables are often referred to as entities. Entities have attributes, similar to columns or fields in a table.
- **Columns/Fields/Attributes**: Columns in a table have unique names and data types, defining the type of values they can hold.
- **Rows/Records**: Each row in a table is called a record, representing a combination of data in the columns.

## Data Types

- **Data Types**: Vary depending on the database system. Common data types include:
  - **String**: Characters and strings.
  - **Numeric**: Whole and approximate numbers.
  - **Date and Time**: Date and time information.
  - **Binary**: Images, files, binary data.

## Domains

- **Domains**: Define legal values that attributes (columns) can hold, ensuring data integrity.
- **Validation Rules**: Domains may include length values and other rules to govern attribute values.

## Primary Key

- **Primary Key**: Uniquely identifies each row or record in a table.
- **Uniqueness**: Usually a column with unique values, e.g., an employee ID.
- **Composite Key**: Can be a combination of columns if a single column doesn't have unique values.

## Summary

You now possess a thorough understanding of database tables and their components. These foundational concepts, including columns, rows, domains, and primary keys, will serve as the building blocks for your journey in working with databases.
